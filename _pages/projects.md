Peer evaluation of interdisciplinary research in scientific publishing
======
* Do interdisciplinary manuscripts incur evaluation penalties in journal peer review? We introduce a theoretical distinction between "input" and "output" interdisciplinarity and examine their association with acceptance rates and reviewer positivity, using administrative data from a physical sciences publisher.
* Advised by Misha Teplitskiy and Daniel Romero
* Revising in preparation for journal submission
