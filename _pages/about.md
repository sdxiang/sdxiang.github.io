I am a 2nd year Ph.D student at the University of Michigan School of Information co-advised by [Misha Teplitskiy](https://www.misha.mx) and [Daniel Romero] (http://www.dromero.org).

My research interests encompass science of science, network science, and dynamical systems. I am interested in studying the dynamics of knowledge production, especially as it relates to the disciplinary structures and epistemic cultures of science.

I graduated from Brown University in 2022 with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and a B.A. in Physics. Since entering graduate school, I have become interested in the way mathematics is understood and rhetorized in other areas of science.
